# 🌊 Near Agent MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enabling smart contract interaction, transaction handling, and event listening on the NEAR blockchain for AI agents and applications.

## 📌 Overview

This MCP server provides seamless integration with the NEAR Protocol blockchain for any MCP-compatible client or agent framework.

- ✅ Execute contract methods and transactions on NEAR blockchain
- ✅ Listen to and respond to contract events with AI processing
- ✅ View contract data and account information
- ✅ Handle custom logic through intelligent event listeners
- ✅ Compatible with any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, custom agents)

## 🔄 AI-Driven Event Processing Workflow

The server enables an "AI in the loop" workflow:

1. 🔗 Smart contract transaction triggers an event and pauses execution
2. 🤖 MCP server detects the event and requests AI processing from the client
3. 🧠 AI client processes the event data and provides intelligent response
4. ↩️ Server sends AI response back to blockchain via transaction
5. ✅ Original smart contract resumes with the AI-provided data

## 🛠 Installation

### Option 1: Using `pnpm dlx` (Recommended)
Run directly without installation:
```bash
pnpm dlx mcp-near-agent
```

### Option 2: Global Installation
```bash
pnpm add -g mcp-near-agent
```

### Option 3: From Source
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd mcp-near-agent
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

## ⚙ Configuration

Set these environment variables in your MCP client configuration:

| 🔧 Variable Name | 🌜 Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| `ACCOUNT_ID` | Your NEAR account ID for authentication 🆔 |
| `ACCOUNT_KEY` | Private key for your NEAR account (ed25519: or secp256k1: format) 🔑 |
| `NEAR_NETWORK_ID` | NEAR network ("mainnet", "testnet", "betanet") - defaults to "mainnet" 🌐 |
| `NEAR_NODE_URL` | Custom NEAR RPC endpoint (optional) 🔗 |
| `NEAR_GAS_LIMIT` | Gas limit for transactions (optional) ⛽ |

## 🚀 MCP Client Configuration

### Custom Agent Framework
```typescript
import { MCPClient } from "your-mcp-client";

const client = new MCPClient({
  serverCommand: "pnpm",
  serverArgs: ["dlx", "mcp-near-agent"],
  serverEnv: {
    ACCOUNT_ID: "your-account.testnet",
    ACCOUNT_KEY: "ed25519:your_private_key_here",
    NEAR_NETWORK_ID: "testnet"
  }
});
```

## 🔧 Available Tools

### `watch_near_event`
Start watching for specific events on a NEAR contract:
```typescript
{
  eventName: "run_agent",           // Event to watch for
  contractId: "contract.testnet",   // Contract to monitor
  responseMethodName: "agent_response", // Method to call with AI response
  cronExpression: "*/10 * * * * *"  // Optional: polling frequency
}
```

### `stop_watching_near_event`
Stop watching for specific events:
```typescript
{
  contractId: "contract.testnet",
  eventName: "run_agent"
}
```

### `list_watched_near_events`
List all currently watched events and statistics:
```typescript
{
  includeStats: true  // Optional: include performance statistics
}
```

## 🎯 Usage Example

1. **Start the MCP server** with your client
2. **Watch for events** using the MCP tool:
   ```
   Use watch_near_event with:
   - eventName: "price_request"
   - contractId: "oracle.testnet"
   - responseMethodName: "price_response"
   ```
3. **AI processes events automatically** when they occur on the blockchain
4. **Monitor with** `list_watched_near_events` to see status and statistics

## 🌜 Event Processing Flow

When a blockchain event is detected:

1. 📡 **Event Detection**: Server monitors blockchain for specified events
2. 🤖 **AI Request**: Server requests sampling from MCP client with event data
3. 🧠 **AI Processing**: Client processes event and returns intelligent response
4. 📤 **Blockchain Response**: Server sends AI response back to contract
5. 📊 **Statistics**: Performance metrics are tracked and available

## 📊 Response Format

The server provides structured responses:

- ✔ **Success/failure status** with detailed messages
- 🔗 **Subscription IDs** for tracking active watchers
- 📈 **Performance statistics** (success rates, processing times)
- 🎯 **Event details** (contract, event type, timestamps)
- 💡 **Helpful guidance** and troubleshooting tips

## ❌ Error Handling

The server handles common NEAR-related errors:

- 🚨 **Invalid contract calls** or method names
- 💸 **Insufficient account balance** for transactions
- 🔑 **Authentication issues** with account credentials
- 🌐 **Network connectivity problems** with NEAR RPC
- 🚫 **Contract execution errors** returned by smart contracts
- ⏱️ **Timeout handling** for long-running operations

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

- **Real-time logging** of all blockchain interactions
- **Performance metrics** for event processing
- **Error tracking** with detailed error messages
- **Statistics dashboard** via `list_watched_near_events`

## 🛡 Security Notes

- **Private keys** are handled securely in memory only
- **Environment variables** should be properly secured
- **Gas limits** prevent runaway transaction costs
- **Error handling** prevents sensitive data leakage
